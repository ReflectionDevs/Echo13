changes:
  - rscdel: Removed high population override from dynamic.
  - bugfix: Fixed abductors being listed at round end on Dynamic despite none existing
  - bugfix: Dynamic abductors should no longer be split up between two different ships.
  - bugfix: Dynamic can now be configured when made the forced secret mode.
  - tweak: dynamic threat reports are no longer perfectly accurate, they diverge and
      are sometimes downright wrong.
  - rscadd: Dynamic now rolls a separate budget for round start and midround antagonists,
      meaning less round start antags will roll in favor of more midround ones.
  - admin: The antag_cap value now uses an equation that scales with population, rather
      than a fixed array.
  - admin: autotraitor_cooldown now uses deciseconds rather than ticks, so the older
      value of 450 now means 45 seconds. Set it to be 9000 if you want it to be accurate
      to the old value (15 minutes), or simply unset it.
  - admin: Midround/latejoin dynamic timers are now configurable.
  - admin: Syndicate Sleeper Agent will now give details when ti fails.
  - bugfix: The autotraitor cooldown now respects configuration, rather than resetting
      back to 15 minutes after it is rolled.
  - bugfix: Fixed dynamic parameters not checking the configuration. This means that
      Manuel will now have slower midrounds, as was intended.
  - rscadd: you can now cast rituals on dynamic if the threat level is 100
  - bugfix: Fixed multiple high impact rulesets being chosen on Dynamic.
  - bugfix: Midround dynamic injection no longer has a 100% chance of activating.
  - rscadd: Dynamic will now play a part in controlling random event antagonists.
      If a dynamic midround injection is coming too soon, or too early, then the next
      midround injection will be buffed. Otherwise, it'll spawn normally.
  - admin: Admins can now cancel or replace midround rulesets.
  - bugfix: Admins can now correctly force midround rulesets.
