changes:
  - rscadd: New hijack! To do it, you must alt-click the shuttle console a series
      of times. After that has been successfully done 5 times, the hijack is complete.
  - rscadd: After each hack, the shuttle in-transit is delayed slightly, and crew
      are also notified of what is going on.
  - rscadd: Who can hijack? Blood brothers, traitors, changelings, wizards, highlanders,
      incursions, nukies, heretics
  - rscdel: Old method of hijack no longer works for ordinary antags, if you want
      your greentext, you MUST secure the console. Not that that'll be difficult compared
      to killing everything.
