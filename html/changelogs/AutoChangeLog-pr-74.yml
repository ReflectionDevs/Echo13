changes:
  - bugfix: Dog beds are now properly tagged, and if your pet bites the dust, the
      bed will be kept in their memory.
  - bugfix: Pre-owned beds now retain their predetermined flavor text.
  - bugfix: Fixed garbage collection of ghosts and lobby players, making the game
      run faster.
  - bugfix: Fixes a very rare edgecase that could cause spawned ghosts to be unable
      to move.
